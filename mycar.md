This APP was developed as part of the course requirement for the
coursera, Developing data products, Data science specialization track.

With this APP you can customize vehicle specifications to your desired
options, and the APP will automatically display the vehicles that meet
your specifications.

The APP gives you the freedom to choose the distance you intend to
travel, the miles/gallon fuel efficiency of your desired vehicle, the
amount of money you intend to spend on gas, the engine cylinder size,
the horse power, and the transmission type (Manual or automatic).

Have fun with it!
